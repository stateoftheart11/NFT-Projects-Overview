  - By staking Shredded Ape, you are sending him to our private gym on the moon. For each day your ape is working out, he'll be getting a paid in $WHEY. It's up to you to decide for how long you want to send your apes to the gym - you can cancel the staking and receive earned rewards at any given time.
