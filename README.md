  - By staking Shredded Ape, you are sending him to our private gym on the moon. For each day your ape is working out, he'll be getting a paid in $WHEY. It's up to you to decide for how long you want to send your apes to the gym - you can cancel the staking and receive earned rewards at any given time.
  - AMOUNT EARNED: 10 $WHEY / Ape staked / Day. Staking 3 or more apes will multiply the amount of $WHEY earned by x1.25

  - Farmers and animals will act as multipliers for token generation when staking. Rarity of your NFTs, and amount staked will affect the multiplier!
  - you will be able to stake your farm (at least one NFT from each collection) to start earning our project's own token($WHEAT) which will be used for gameplay in season 2. The more quantity of farmers/animals as well as higher rarities will generate you more tokens.
  - Staking will be limited to 3 farmers and 3 animals per land plot.
  - You will need to pay a 20% tax on each harvest to the bandits to harvest your wheat, or you can risk harvesting all your wheat (with a chance to lose all to bandits) but you will need to have staked for at least 3 days.
